### [Objective disadvantages of the 5X:](https://t.me/FF_5M_5M_Pro/602736/1124908)


## Hardware:
1. Poor nozzle - can be replaced with a bamboo one from A1/A1 mini or from Triange
2. Poor heater - often burns out. You can replace the head with a bambumod
3. Sometimes the coil mounts click. They are replaced under warranty
4. Unsuccessful 4-in-1 module. Replaced with a new one under warranty. Print it yourself
5. The IFS module firmware may crash. They send a new one under warranty, and the broken one can be reflashed.
6. The z-offset is periodically lost. Remove the bed card before printing. Use the g28_tenz plugin on zmod.

## Software:
1. Closed firmware only allows working through native Orca FF or Flashprint applications (but Chinese servers occasionally go down). You can use zmod + regular Orca
2. Files get corrupted. Not a problem when working with native firmware and native applications. When working with zmod, you need to enable MD5 check
3. Lots of waste on native firmware. You need to read the instructions and configure on zmod if you want to reduce it.
4. No web interface. Install zmod
5. Compressed camera image. Install zmod
